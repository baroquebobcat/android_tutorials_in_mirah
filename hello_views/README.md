Hello, Views
=====================

This is a collection of "Hello World"-style tutorials designed to get you started quickly with common Android layouts and widgets.

A certain amount of knowledge is assumed for these tutorials. Before you start, you should have completed the Hello, World tutorialâ€”it will teach you several things about basic Android development. More specifically, you should know:

How to create an Android project and run it
The basic structure of an Android project (resource files, layout files, etc.)
The basic components of an Activity
Note: In order to make these tutorials as simple as possible, some code may not conform to best practices for coding Android applications. In particular, hard-coded strings are used in places, when the better practice is to reference strings from a res/values/strings.xml resource file.

Tip: After you have pasted sample code into an Eclipse project, press Ctrl (or Cmd) + Shift + O to import the required packages.
